# Intro

This repository contains data that
fuels [Azur Lane Calculator](https://azurlane.mrlar.dev/calculator)
and [Azur Lane Database](https://azurlane.mrlar.dev/db).

Please make sure to read the [License](LICENSE.md) file as well as the [License Section](#license)
before using this data.

# Reason for this Repository

Unlike the actual source of the aforementioned projects, this data may be of use to
others. This repository exists to encourage people to use this data to build
APIs, Applets, Websites or other Azur Lane related programms. While this repository and the
data in it has a clear focus in mind there is no harm in expanding it further
(Just ask if you need something not already covered!).

Additionally, providing this data allows people who spot issues to either point them out, or open PRs to
correct them. PRs to the custom parsers are preffered, since this data is build using
them. Meaning any inconsistency is the result of an error in the parser.

It is also worth mentioning that even if this repository did not exist nearly all the data would be
easily obtainable anyway, due to how efficiently serving JSON data through the web works.

# Documentation

You can find your way around the JSON files using the [documentation](https://azurlane.mrlar.dev/AzurLaneData).
